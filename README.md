# Tower Defense
Create a PC Tower Defense game using Unity and C#.

## Implementations

## Assumptions
- You are using the 1920x1080 or any 16:9 aspect device, itâ€™s not a good experience for the 16:10 aspect.
- You will see enemies appear in the top left of the screen and disappear on the right side of the screen.
- You will see the player's HP on the top left corner of the screen. When enemies reach the right side of the screen, enemies will reduce the player's HP.
- You will see the current wave on the top left corner of the screen. The current wave will increase when all enemies are dead, and there are no more enemies.
- You can click the tower icon on the right side of the panel, then place the tower in the space except for the road.
- You can see the tower turn in direction and attack when enemies enter the tower range.
- You can see enemies disappear when the tower kills them.
